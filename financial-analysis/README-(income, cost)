ðŸ“Š Financial Analysis Tool (Python)
This script is a simple financial analysis utility that takes investment details, yearly income, and yearly cost, then calculates key financial metrics such as NPV, IRR, Payback Period, and Discounted Payback Period.
âœ¨ Features
â€¢	Net Present Value (NPV) calculation
â€¢	Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculation
â€¢	Payback Period (undiscounted)
â€¢	Discounted Payback Period
â€¢	Neatly formatted yearly table showing income, cost, and net cash flow
ðŸ“¦ Requirements
You need Python 3 and the following packages:
pip install numpy numpy-financial
ðŸš€ How to Run
Run the script in your terminal:
python financial.py
The script will prompt for:
1.	Number of years
2.	Initial investment (positive number)
3.	Discount rate (as a decimal or percentage, e.g., 0.1 or 10)
4.	Income and cost for each year in the format income,cost (e.g., 50000,20000)
ðŸ“‹ Example Input/Output
Input:
enter number of years: 3
enter initial investment (positive number): 100000
enter discount rate (e.g., 0.1 for 10% or 10 for 10%): 10
input(income,cost) for year 1: 50000,20000
input(income,cost) for year 2: 60000,25000
input(income,cost) for year 3: 70000,30000
Output:
Net Present Value (NPV): 24132.21
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) %: 18.45
Payback Period (years): 3
Discounted Payback Period (years): 3
